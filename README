The goal of this project is to evaluate whether it is feasible to implement a
WebIDL-compliant HTML5 DOM in JavaScript. While a couple other self-hosted
JavaScript DOM implementations exist, none of them are WebIDL-compliant
(i.e. properties don't live on the prototype but directly on each node, for
example). Also, all other implementations do not provide proper encapsulation.
The details of the implementation leak through the API.

For full WebIDL compliance the JavaScript engine has to support Proxies
and weak maps. Firefox/SpiderMonkey support Proxies, but the current
implementation as of Firefox 4 doesn't bind the receiver object to 'this' in
handler traps. A series of patches is required to fix this:

I am trying to coordinate with TC39 to get this change into the Harmony draft
spec, and I will get the patches into Firefox 5 if that succeeds.

The Harmony weak maps proposal is not currently implemented in any browser.
I have a patch I will try to get into Firefox 5:

dom.js is ridicilously incomplete. I am interested in correctness, performance,
and code quality (in that order). Completeness is not a near or mid-term goal.
This project is useless for anything but R&D of a self-hosted DOM.
