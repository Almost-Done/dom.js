The file ms2ger_tests.html runs a small suite of domcore tests created
by Ms2ger and available from the w3c.  Before running the tests, you
must clone the w3c repo that contains them:

   hg clone https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webapps

Once you've done that, the tests in question are here:

   webapps/DOMCore/tests/submissions/Ms2ger/

(Those tests load /resources/testharness.js and
/resources/testharnessreport.js which probably refer to these files:
http://w3c-test.org/resources/testharness.js
http://w3c-test.org/resources/testharnessreport.js.  Note though that
the way we run them here we've got our own harness.js file and don't
need them)
