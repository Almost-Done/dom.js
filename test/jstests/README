These tests are intended to be run with jstests.py.  They have been converted from tests available in http://www.w3c-test.org/webapps/DOMCore/tests/submissions/Ms2ger/.

pre-dom/dom.js/shell.js is a copy of dom.js, and should not be directly modified.

There are two targets in the Makefile to run these tests, with more notes in the Makefile.
